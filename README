bootstrap.py downloads and sets up buildout in the current directory

choose a python to run bootstrap.py 

once you choose a python your buildout project will always use that version of python

bootstrap.py will download setuptools and buildout into the eggs directory
and will create a script called bin/buildout which contains those eggs plus the 
version of python that you used to run bootstrap
